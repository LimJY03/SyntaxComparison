# **SyntaxComparison**

This project is created to help coders and programmers switching between programming languages to learn the new language faster. We assume that coders and programmers viewing this repo have the basic understanding on most concepts in programming.

## **Problem Statement**

Most coders and programmers that are switching languages took a long time in learning the new language. We noticed that in more than half of the time, **they are learning the concepts that they have already knew beforehand** because most courses out there assumed their students to be new to programming. 

We also noticed through our own experiences that these coders and programmers that are switching between programming languages just want to **learn, understand and master the syntax** of a specific programming language.

## **Solution**

To solve this problem, we created this project to help all coders and programmers that want to learn syntax of new programming languages quick and effectively. In this project, we **compiled a series of code syntax** of multiple programming languages that are under similar programming concepts into a folder to aid coders and programmers in understanding them effectively.

Coders and programmers are able to view the new syntax of the language they are switching to, with reference to the syntax of the language they are more used to. This **comparison view** should help to improve understanding on new syntax faster.

## **How To Use?**

It is very simple to use this repository.

1. Navigate to the programming concept where you wish to learn its syntax.
2. Look in the `README.md` file and search for the programming language where you wish to learn its syntax.
3. Explore the [links](https://github.com/LimJY03/SyntaxComparison) attached in the file to learn more.
4. View the **code samples** in `Sample Codes` folder to better understand its application.

## **Can I Contribute To This Project?**

We welcome professionals to contribute to this project so that we can support more programming languages. Feel free to *make a pull request* and add the programming language of preference to each section for every programming concepts. 

More enquires can be made [here](mailto:limjunyi03@gmail.com).
