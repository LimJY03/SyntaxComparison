While the console output does not require any library imports, user input does require `import java.util.Scanner;` .

## Output

To let the program print to the console, we can use the `System.out.print()` statement.

To print the next statements in a new line, we can use `System.out.println()`. It is basically a `System.out.print([anything] + "\n")`

## Input

To accept input from the user, the norm is to make a `Scanner` object.

Getting different datatypes of input also requires different functions of the `Scanner` class to be called.'

Let `sc` be our Scanner object for these common input datatypes.

| Function | Datatype / Input |
| :---: | :---: |
| `sc.next()` | The next *word* as a `String` |
| `sc.nextLine()` | The next *line* as a `String` |
| `sc.nextInt()` | `int` |
| `sc.nextDouble()` | `double` |
| `sc.next.charAt(n)` | The `char` at the *n*th index. |
| `sc.nextBoolean()` | `boolean` |

Note that other than `nextLine()`, the other inputs are delimited by `whitespace` or `newline` character. Using the wrong input function results in a runtime error.

# C++

To use input and output statements, we have to include the `<iostream>` header file.

## Output

To let the program print to the console, we can use the `std::cout` statement.

There are a few ways to print in a new line, including using the `\n` escape character. Another way is to use `std::endl`.

## Input

To accept input from a user, we can use `std::cin`.

However, for `string`, `std::cin` only works for the first word as `whitespace` is a delimiter.

Therefore we can use the `getline(cin, varName)` function to read an entire line. This function requires `#include <string>`.

`C++` also supports reading multiple inputs in one line. The values can be declared by using `whitespace` between inputs in the console and using the `>>` operator between variables in the program.

# C

To use input and output statements, we have to include the `<stdio.h>` header file.

## Output

To let the program print to the console, we can use the `printf("outputstring", var)` statement.

Format specifiers are used together with the `printf()` function to tell the compiler what type of data the variable is storing. It is basically a placeholder for the variable value.

The standard way to print a new line is using the escape character `\n`. There is no `endl` syntax in `C`.

The format specifiers (initials `FS`) are as shown below:

| FS | Datatype |
| :---: | :---: |
| `%d` or `%i` | int |
| `%f` | float |
| `%lf` | double |
| `%c` | char |
| `%s` | string (char[]) |

### Example

```C
double myNum = 5.13;
char myLetter = 'D';
printf("My number is %.2lf and my letter is %c.", myNum, myLetter);

// Output:
// My number is 5.13 and my letter is D.
```

The values of the variables will be substituted into the format specifiers according to the order in the output string.

To format decimal places, use `%.xf` or `%.xlf`, where `x` is the number of decimal places. If this is not specified, the default output will always output 6 decimal places.

## Input

To accept input from a user, we can use `scanf("FS", var)` or `scanf_s("FS", var)` (recommended in Visual Studio in contrast to `scanf` as it has better security features).

However, for `string`, `scanf` and `scanf_s` only works for the first word as `whitespace` is a delimiter, and `scanf_s` requires another buffer size parameter.

Therefore we can use `%[^\n]s` as the FS to read an entire line. The buffer size will normally be the size of the string by using `sizeof(yourString)`.

`C` also supports reading multiple inputs in one line. The values can be declared, for example `(%d %d, x, y)` will read 2 integer values seperated by a space and assign it into `x` and `y` respectively.

# C#

User input and console output does not require header files. However, normally `using System;` is included in the top of the program.
It means that we can use classes from the System namespace.

If you omit the `using System;` line, you would have to write `System.Console.WriteLine();` to print/output text.

## Output

To let the program print to the console, we can use the `Console.Write()` statement.

To print the next statements in a new line, we can use `Console.WriteLine()`. It is basically a `Console.Write([anything] + "\n")`

## Input

To accept input from the user, we can use `datatype var = Console.ReadLine();`.

`C#` only supports reading the entire line as a string. In order to assign values according to their respective datatypes, `Convert` functions are used:

| `Convert._____(Console.ReadLine());` | Datatype |
| :---: | :---: |
| `ToDouble` | double |
| `ToInt32` | int |
| `ToBoolean` | bool |
| `ToInt64` | long |
| `ToChar` | first character to char |

#### TL;DR:

| Language | Input | Output |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Python |  | `print` |
| JavaScript |  | `console.log()` |
| Java | using `Scanner` object | `System.out.print/ln()` |
| C++ | `std::cin`, `getline()` | `std::cout` |
| C | `scanf()`, `scanf_s()` | `printf` |
| C# | `Console.ReadLine()` | `Console.Write/Line()` |
